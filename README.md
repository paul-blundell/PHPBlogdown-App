# PHPBlogdown App

This is a ready-to-use application that uses the PHPBlogdown core (paul-blundell/phpblogdown).

Simply upload this to your server and drop your markdown files in the `posts` directory.

This is intended as an example of what you can do. Hopefully the app is flexible enough for your needs.
