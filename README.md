# PHPBlogdown App

This is a ready-to-use application that uses the PHPBlogdown core (paul-blundell/phpblogdown).

Simply upload this to your server and drop your markdown files in the `posts` directory.

This is intended as an example of what you can do. Hopefully the app is flexible enough for your needs.


## Installation

For now, run the following:

    git clone https://github.com/paul-blundell/phpblogdown-app.git
    cd phpblogdown-app
    composer install
    
Make sure to update the `config.ini` file `src/`
